=====================================================
This project aims at learning about Stochastic Programming, by using the book "Introduction to Stochastic Programming", 2nd edition, by Birge and Louveaux.
Applications are coded in Julia, notably using JuMP for Mathematical Programming.

Chapter 1 - Introduction and examples

The farming example introduces a farm where some elements are uncertain:
- the yield of planted elements
- the buying and selling price of these elements at the marketplace
Analysis of robustness and performance is exposed and the notion of several stages where to make decisions.
